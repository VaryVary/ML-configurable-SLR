# Learning Software Configuration Spaces: A Systematic Literature Review

Cite our paper: Pereira, J. A., Acher, M., Martin, H., Jézéquel, J. M., Botterweck, G., & Ventresque, A. (2021). Learning software configuration spaces: A systematic literature review. Journal of Systems and Software, 182, 111044.


* Motivation: What studies have been reported in the literature on learning software configuration spaces since the introduction of Software Product Lines to date (2019)? 
 * Based on a systematic literature review
   * we provide a framework classification of four main stages: Sampling, Measuring, Learning, and Validation
   * we identified different applications (pure prediction, optimization, specialization, interpretability, etc.)
   * we review subject systems and application domains 
   * we describe numerous sampling strategies 
   * we detail how configurations are measured 
   * we report on learning algorithms used and their assessment 
   * we identify severeal open challenges faced by the current approaches

* Data Extraction
  * see [primary studies](https://github.com/VaryVary/ML-configurable-SLR/blob/master/primary-studies.xlsx) and [results](https://github.com/VaryVary/ML-configurable-SLR/blob/master/results.xlsx).

* More Info
  * see [charts](https://github.com/VaryVary/ML-configurable-SLR/tree/master/charts).
