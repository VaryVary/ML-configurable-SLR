# Learning Software Configuration Spaces: A Systematic Literature Review

* Motivation: What studies have been reported in the literature on learning software configuration spaces since the introduction of Software Product Lines to date (2019)? 
 * Based on a systematic literature review
   * we provide a framework classification of four main stages: Sampling, Measuring, Learning, and Validation
   * we identified different applications (pure prediction, optimization, specialization, interpretability, etc.)
   * we review subject systems and application domains 
   * we describe numerous sampling strategies 
   * we detail how configurations are measured 
   * we report on learning algorithms used and their assessment 
   * we identify severeal open challenges faced by the current approaches

* Data Extraction
  * see [primary studies](https://github.com/VaryVary/ML-configurable-SLR/edit/master/primary-studies.xls) and [results](https://github.com/VaryVary/ML-configurable-SLR/edit/master/results.xls).
